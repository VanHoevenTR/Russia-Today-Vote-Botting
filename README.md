_Tool in action_

There are downvoter bots who kept mass downvoting pro-ukrainian comments, I figured out it was Z__Z__Z who was behind of it [(PROOF)](https://github.com/VanHoevenTR/Russia-Today-Vote-Botting/tree/main/Images/Proof). I also been hit by these bots and my account now got banned, so I decided to create my own bots written in C# and fight back :D. I'm not good in C#, so code might be messy

Because I do not know how to bypass invisible captcha, I use tokens. It can be easly obtained from the browser after logged in (Explained below). PLEASE TELL ME if you know how to bypass captcha. We could do more fun stuff :D
